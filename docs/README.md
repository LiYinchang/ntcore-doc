# Overview
---
NT-Core is an open source MLOps platform to help user developing, testing, versioning and deploying models. NT-Core provides the complete machine learning and data science development experience, which could substantially reduce the time between creating models and deploying them to the target environment. NT-Core platform provides four key features, including: development IDE, model experiment, model versioning and model deployment.

- **Development IDE**<br>
  NT-Core leverage jupyter notebook to provide seamless development experience，supporting multiple frameworks and languages. The development environment allows you run code, display the output, and also add explanations, formulas, charts, and make your work more transparent, understandable, repeatable, and shareable.  

  Check out more details about [**development**](tutorial.md#Development).

- **Model experiment**<br>
  Machine learning project normally involves many experiments with different models and it has far more branching and experimentation than a typical software project. NT-Core platform keeping all of your model experiments organized and having a process that lets you draw the best results.

  Check out more details about [**experiment**](tutorial.md#Experiment).

- **Model versioning**<br>
  Machine Learning (ML) involves rapid experimentation and iteration, and you won't learn much without tracking your modeling history. NT-Core provided git-like version feature to let you keep track of all of your models, how well they’ve done, and what hyperparameters you used to get there.

  Check out more details about [**versioning**](tutorial.md#Versioning).

- **Model deployment**<br>
  <em>"No machine learning model is valuable, unless it’s deployed to production"</em>. Model deployment could be the most difficult and yet critical operation in the whole process. More than 87% of data science projects never make it to production. NT-Core platform helps you deploy model easily with multiple supported frameworks and languages.
