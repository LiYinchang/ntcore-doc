# Overview
---
NTCore is an open source machine learning development and operations (MLOps) platform designed to help users develop, test, control model versions and deploy models. NTCore provides a complete development experience for machine learning and data science, significantly reducing the time and cost required between creating a model and deploying it to a target environment. The NTCore platform provides four key features, including: Development IDE, Model experiment, Model versioning and Model deployment.

- **Development IDE**<br>
  The NTCore platform leverages jupyter notebook to provide a seamless development experience, supporting multiple frameworks and languages. The rich text development environment makes model development more transparent, understandable, repeatable and sharable.

  Check out more details about [**development**](tutorial.md#Development).

- **Model experiment**<br>
  Machine learning projects require multiple experiments between different models, often requiring more managed branches and experiments than a normal software development project. the NTCore platform records all model experiments, compares data and obtains the best experimental results.

  Check out more details about [**experiment**](tutorial.md#Experiment).

- **Model versioning**<br>
  The NTCore platform provides a Git-like version control feature that allows users to quickly experiment and iterate, keep track of all model versions stored, and compare important parameters.

  Check out more details about [**versioning**](tutorial.md#Versioning).

- **Model deployment**<br>
  Model deployment is perhaps the most difficult but critical operation in the entire machine learning development process, with over 87% of machine learning and data science projects never going into production. the NTCore platform helps users easily deploy models to a variety of target environments.

  Check out more details about [**deployment**](tutorial.md#Deployment).
